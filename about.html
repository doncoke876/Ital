      <p>
       
        As Sous Chef, Shadrick Jones brings his years of culinary<br>
         experience to the ANGELOU'S ITALIAN-JAMAICAN RISTORANTE kitchen where he creates custom<br>
          menus with his team of talented chefs. Shadrick started at a<br>
           very young age, spending every waking moment he could in the<br>
            kitchen next to his mother. By the age of five Shadrick would<br>
             be found kneading dough on the dining room table or in Old Harbour, Saint Catherine,<br>
              fishing for King Salmon that were bigger than him. He<br>
               grew up in Kingston, Jamaica where he found his passion for<br>
                the Culinary Arts. After working in multiple kitchens for fifteen<br>
                 years he finally decided to attend culinary school at the University<br>
                  of the West Indies in Jamaica.
